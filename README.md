### 🧠 Neural Network Basics
- Building your first **fully-connected (linear) neural network**
- Using `nn.Linear`
- Understanding:
  - Input features  
  - Output classes  
  - Layers  

---

### ⚙️ Weights & Biases
- What weights represent  
- What bias means  
- How they affect the model output  

Example:
```python
print(linear_layer.weight)
print(linear_layer.bias)
